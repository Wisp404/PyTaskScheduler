# PyTaskScheduler
PyTaskScheduler is a Python script for simplified management of scheduled tasks on Unix systems. 

It allows users to create permanent aliases in the bashrc file and configure recurring tasks using crontab.

With an intuitive interface, users can easily define custom aliases and schedule command executions at specific intervals, ranging from minutes to years. 

PyTaskScheduler streamlines the process with clear prompts and interactive options.
